# TP-IOT

I created a node application with **Typescript** and **Javascript** framework **Express.JS**. 

This app collects humidity and temperature data generated by sensors, thanks to node app in folder **tp-iot-main**.

Open a terminal and install dependencies into the **root folder** and **tp-iot-main** folder :

```
npm i

```

My node app runs with a Typescript compiler who transform Typescript in Javascript(ts-node), so you have to start a terminal and write :

```
ts-node index.ts

```

You have also in **graphs pictures** some screens in **Grafana**, and **InfluxDB Data Explorer**
